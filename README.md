# Todo React App

My historical Todo App, always almost finished. And always different.

## Getting Started

Just put a list. And insert your Todos. Modify them. And delete them by completing them! No cheating. Everything will be there at your return.

## Versioning

1.0: Basic todo list.

## Authors

- **Marco Sandri** - _All the work_ - [Marco Sandri](https://github.com/marcosandri-dev)

## Future Features

- Creating a "SERIOUS" login page.
- Creating the possibility to switch between lists within the page.
